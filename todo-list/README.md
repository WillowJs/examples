# Todo List Component

This component provides a simple Todo list that you can add items to. In order for it to work you will need to have Postgres installed as well as knex (`npm install -g knex`). Update knexfile.js to include your database name, username and password. Then run `knex migrate:latest` and `gulp serve`. You should be good to go.
