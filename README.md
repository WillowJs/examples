# Examples of Willow components

Below you'll find a list of example Willow components that you can browse to get a better idea of how they work. To play around with these components, clone this repository and cd into the directory of the component that you want to play around with. `npm install` the necessary modules in that directory and follow any other instructions that the component specifies in its README. Finally, run `gulp serve` within the component directory and visit http://localhost:3000

One thing to keep in mind as you browse through this code is that everything is boilerplate except for the components directory. Everying except for the components directory will eventually be able to be auto-generated with Yeoman.
